## Group communication and code sharing strategy
- We created a group chat in Microsoft Teams for easy and efficient communication. Moreover, we all work in Lahti Campus - here we schedule small meetings for discussing the problem, determining goals and estimating workload. 
- We created a [project repository in Github](https://github.com/EmiliLed/Advanced-Data-Analysis-Mining-Project) for sharing the code and tracking the progress and solving possible issues together. 

## Data initial description. Importing data
The	dataset	originates	from	a	mining	process,	from	the	froth	flotation	phase.	The	process	is	
successful	 if	 there	 is	 as	 little	 outlet	 silica	 content	 as	 possible.	 There	 are	 24	 variables	
(columns)	in	the	data.	The main goal is to use this data to predict how much impurity (silica content) is in the ore concentrate.

The first column shows time and date range (from march of 2017 until september of 2017). Some columns were sampled every 20 second. Others were sampled on a hourly base. The second and third columns are quality measures of the iron ore pulp right before it is fed into the flotation plant. Column 4 until column 8 are the most important variables that impact in the ore quality in the end of the process. From column 9 until column 22, we can see process data (level and air flow inside the flotation columns, which also impact in ore quality. The last two columns are the final iron ore pulp quality measurement from the lab.
Target is to predict the last column, which is the % of silica in the iron ore concentrate.
